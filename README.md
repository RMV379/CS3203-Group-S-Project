Product Vision:
FOR creative social media users WHO are looking for an alternative to Twitter the PRODUCT, our project, is a novel text based social media application THAT allows users to make character-strict posts only once per day. UNLIKE Twitter and other social media applications that have become merely an outlet for anyone and everyone to speak everything on their mind, OUR PRODUCT only allows users to post once per day and changes the character limit between 1 and 256 characters each day, encouraging thoughtful and creative posts every single time.

Compile UserInput with:
g++ UserInput.cpp -o temp1
